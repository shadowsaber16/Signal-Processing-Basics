The theory questions has been scanned and attached to in the Code folder as the 'Analytical part'.

Question 1.1: Finding Fourier series coefficients.

The function is named fourierCoeff.m which calculates the FS coefficients.

for the sub part 'a' the file name is first_a, which is a script file using the function fourierCoeff to calculate the fourier coefficients for the given x(t)
for the sub part 'b' we have attached the scanned file doing the analytical calculations to verify the answers.
for the sub part 'c' the file name first_c, which is a script file using the function fourierCoeff to calculate the fourier coefficients for the assumed function of our choice.
The plots have been attached in the Result folder.

Question 1.2: FS reconstruction and finite FS approximation error.

for the sub part 'a', the file name Q2a.m, uses the function partialfouriersum to reconstruct the signal from question 1 using the FS coefficients calculated in question 1.
for the sub part 'b', the file name Q2b.m, both the original and reconstructed signal is plotted.

******There is not any significant difference in the original signal and the reconstructed signal except at the point t = 0.


for the sub part 'c', the file name Q2c.m, both the errors are computed.
for the sub part 'd', the file name Q2d.m,
The mean squared error is negligible and the maximum absolute error , both can be seen in the plot.

Question 1.3: Gibbs Phenomenon – square wave.

for the sub part 'a', the scanned file has been attached calculating the fourier coefficients.

******(b)for the sub part 'b', the file name Q3b10.m and Q3b100.m.
Increasing the time period decreases the amplitude of ak as we get the term 1/T in the calculation of ak.

for the sub part 'c', the file name Q3c.m
All the plots for different values of t and N in 1.3 b and 1.3 c has been attached in the result folder.

********(d) The value of y where the maximum overshoot is achieved moves closer and closer to the discontinuity as N increases.  The Nth partial sum has large oscillations near the jump, the oscillations keep on decreasing as the N increases.

Question 1.4: Fourier series – more examples and symmetry properties

for the sub part 'a' the file name is Q4a.m, using the function fourierCoeff. The result for that has been attached in the result folder.
for the sub part 'b' the file name is Q4b.m, using the function fourierCoeff. The result for that has been attached in the result folder.

*******(c) The results were as expected, the fourier coefficients follow the respective symmetry property for both the questions.
The symmetry property for part 'a' is:
   a_k = a(-k) as xt being an even function.
The symmetry property for part 'b' is:
   a_k = -a(-k) as xt being an odd function.
